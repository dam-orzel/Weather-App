# Weather App

The application is available on https://weather-app-vuejs.netlify.com. To start using it, simply enter the desired location in the text field and press the "Check" or enter key on your keyboard. When we manage to find the location, the current temperature and weather conditions will appear. In addition, the history of the locations you've searched for will be saved in the box at the bottom of the application for even faster access*. If you enter the wrong location, the current weather does not appear and the text box lights up red. You can use the application on any type of device. For a better experience, the background of the application will change, and the background graphics will match the current weather in your location.

Dev Info:
The application uses VueX so that the logic of global variables is optimized and available globally throughout the application.

Unfortunately, the lack of time did not allow to complete the logic of downloading your location and displaying the weather automatically.

The application uses PWA technology making it a suitable alternative to native phone applications.
